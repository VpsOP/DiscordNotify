    <br> 
</p>

## How to Set it up?
The setup is actually very simple. All you need is just the webhook url. If you don't know about Webhooks and how to make a webhook i will suggest you to read `MAKING A WEBHOOK` section of this [article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). 

Once you get the webhook url go to `plugin_data` folder of your Pocketmine installation and Open `config.yml` inside `DiscordNotify` folder and paste the webhook url in place of `Your Discord Webhook URL`. then choose a Username for your Webhook and it's done. Now the plugin will send a mesasge whever a player logs in or out of the server.
